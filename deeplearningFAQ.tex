\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Why do we use matrices in deep learning?}
Because it's badass.

\section{How do I visualize a neural network?}
By using matrices.

\section{What are affine transformations?}
Think Linear.

\section{Why use deeplearning with so many layers instead of one layer with many neurons?}
Because non-linearity, bitches.

\section{But what happens if I don't use activation functions?}
It's useless. Then, you might as well stop calling it deeplearning, it's your traditional Machine Learning.
